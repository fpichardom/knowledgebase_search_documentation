== CKAN customization

CKAN is advertised as highly customizable and extensible. It has a modular nature in which customization are done via creating extensions with plugins, and therefore avoiding to manipulate core code directly. This allows for an easier update process as all of the core code repository can be overwritten without major consequences if following the best practices for CKAN.
